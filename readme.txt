Hey Dennis, here's the repo I talked about making over break.

I think what we could do is make a subdirectory for a specific challenge from PE, then post our respective code to it. Or, we could just have entirely separate branches again, and merge to master whichever program or features we like best.

GOALS:
+get more comfortable with collaboration
+get more comfortable with git 
+push each other to practice more code
+learn from other coding styles
+exposure to other code/experience reading other code

..and so on.

Also, I kind of want to start learning Python and it's sort of the go to language in the math/data world increasingly.

Let me know if this is still interesting to you and if you want to change goals of this or anything
